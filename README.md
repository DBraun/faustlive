# FaustLive 


## The swiss knife for [Faust](https://faust.grame.fr) development.

### [Grame](http://www.grame.fr) - Centre National de Creation Musicale

The goal of this project is to build a standalone application that embeds Faust (as the libfaust library) and LLVM compiler to provide dynamical compilation for the Faust programming language.

To build FaustLive, youâ€™ll have to go to the folder "Build" and follow the platform specific README.
